<h2>About</h2>

<p>
A showcase for Hendrix students to highlight their work with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and to share these datasets. We emphasize work in Anthropology and Environmental Studies, focusing especially on questions of environmental justice. The entries here are authored by students and are based on work that they have done in their undergraduate studies at Hendrix. Each one offers a brief description of their work, with maps and links to GIS datasets they want to share with colleagues around world.
