<p>I utilized QGIS to investigate possible links between the distribution of traffic pollution and oppressed communities in the state of Arkansas. Using publicly available traffic data from the Arkansas Department of Transportation, I produced a heatmap modeling a “plume” of automobile pollution across the entire state. Zonal statistics allowed me to compare the distribution and thickness of this “plume” across census tracts, and see if poorer and less white areas were exposed to more traffic pollution on average. Across the board I found significant positive correlations between an area’s level of traffic pollution and that area’s proportion of impoverished and/or nonwhite residents. Furthermore, I suggest that federally mandated monitors responsible for reporting an area’s air quality may be ignoring the most polluted areas of cities, thereby painting an inaccurate picture of how much pollution people are actually exposed.

<p>I utilized GIS in my undergraduate thesis research as I examined UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS). I became particularly interested in the relationship between what is deemed culturally important by those in power and the legacy of colonialism and racism. In my research, I broadly looked at the distribution of all 1,154 WHS with an expectation that there would be a large cluster of sites in Europe resulting from bias in qualifying criteria. I expected that this Eurocentric bias would be discernible through both a perfunctory visual examination and a quantitative analysis. The maps that I created using QGIS include the ones pictured here: three choropleths that demonstrate the number of WHS in every country, in Europe, and in Southeast Asia. I chose to utilize Europe and Southeast Asia as my case study regions due to their comparable populations and because of the often held belief that Western (European) culture is more highly regarded than Eastern (Southeast Asian) cultures. The tangible heritage that UNESCO prioritizes in their criteria for WHS encourages representational inequality as it makes the process of gaining recognition as a site less convoluted for the European nations that favor physical culture. It is unsurprising that UNESCO’s criteria favors that of the dominant Western ideals as Europeans had a large hand in creating the list and implicitly sought to emphasize their own heritage sites. If heritage was the only qualification that WHS were based on, the sites would likely reflect global population density, as the likelihood of grander cultural sites increase as population grows. Instead, biases and the legacy of colonialism implicitly alter the qualifications for sites to gain the UNESCO awarded status. This discrepancy is necessary to address because a site’s inclusion in UNESCO’s list influences the public’s opinions as to what is most important from the past and what has relevance today, so sites that are not included are ignored or deemed unimportant, despite their actual significance to the culture they belong to.

<h2 id="an-exhibit-of-markdown">An exhibit of Markdown</h2>

<p><em>Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn’t automatically save itself.</em></p>

<h2 id="basic-formatting">Basic formatting</h2>

<p>Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.</p>

<p>Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> is supported. This <em>can be <strong>nested</strong> like</em> so.</p>

<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>

<h3 id="ordered-list">Ordered list</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>A second item</li>
  <li>Number 3</li>
  <li>Ⅳ</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm">Roman numeral four</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="unordered-list">Unordered list</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An item</li>
  <li>Another item</li>
  <li>Yet another item</li>
  <li>And there’s more…</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="paragraph-modifiers">Paragraph modifiers</h2>

<h3 id="code-block">Code block</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline code</code> to add code into other things.</p>

<h3 id="quote">Quote</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>

<p>There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You’ve probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.</p>

<h3 id="headings-can-also-contain-formatting">Headings <em>can</em> also contain <strong>formatting</strong></h3>

<h3 id="they-can-even-contain-inline-code">They can even contain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline code</code></h3>

<p>Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.</p>

<p>I don’t recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you’re smallest heading isn’t too small, and you’re largest heading isn’t too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.</p>

<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>

<p>URLs can be made in a handful of ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A named link to <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a>. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+L</code>.</li>
  <li>Another named link to <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a></li>
  <li>Sometimes you just want a URL like <a href="https://www.markitdown.net/">https://www.markitdown.net/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="horizontal-rule">Horizontal rule</h2>

<p>A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s sometimes handy for breaking things up.</p>

<h2 id="images">Images</h2>

<p>Markdown can also contain images. I’ll need to add something here sometime.</p>

<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>

<p>There’s actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">introduction</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">syntax</a> for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.</p>]]></content><author><name>your name</name></author><category term="markdown" /><category term="example" /><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This note demonstrates some of what Markdown is capable of doing.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mathjax Test</title><link href="/jekyll-theme-yat/markdown/2018/05/26/mathjax-test.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mathjax Test" /><published>2018-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/jekyll-theme-yat/markdown/2018/05/26/mathjax-test</id><content type="html" xml:base="/jekyll-theme-yat/markdown/2018/05/26/mathjax-test.html"><![CDATA[<ul>

<p>Some of you know that we occasionally play for weddings. As you can imagine, we get a LOT of requests for Canon in D, and we discovered that there were no good arrangements available anywhere for piano and cello! Hard to believe given its popularity. So we decided to make our own! We tried to stick as closely to the original as possible (which was written for three violins and basso continuo), and we performed it <em>not</em> at a snail’s pace so the bride can actually make it down the aisle without putting everyone to sleep. 🙊(Yeah, we said it! Nobody likes a slow processional!) Also, the number one complaint about this piece from cellists is always how booooring it is to play because they literally have to play the same 8 bass notes over and over for the entire piece. Problem solved with this arrangement because the cello never has to play the bass! 🙌(The piano does, but we get lots of other fun stuff too so it’s ok!)

As you can imagine, we get a LOT of requests for Canon in D, and we discovered that there were no good arrangements available anywhere for piano and cello! Hard to believe given its popularity. So we decided to make our own! We tried to stick as closely to the original as possible (which was written for three violins and basso continuo), and we performed it not at a snail’s pace so the bride can actually make it down the aisle without putting everyone to sleep. 🙊(Yeah, we said it! Nobody likes a slow processional!) Also, the number one complaint about this piece from cellists is always how booooring it is to play because they literally have to play the same 8 bass notes over and over for the entire piece. Problem solved with this arrangement because the cello never has to play the bass! 🙌(The piano does, but we get lots of other fun stuff too so it’s ok!) So for all you musicians out there playing weddings, we hope you enjoy playing this arrangement a little more than the ones you were used to…You can get it from www.musicnotes.com. 😊Be sure to let us know in the comments if you do!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Table example</title><link href="/jekyll-theme-yat/example/2017/12/15/table-example.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Table example" /><published>2017-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/jekyll-theme-yat/example/2017/12/15/table-example</id><content type="html" xml:base="/jekyll-theme-yat/example/2017/12/15/table-example.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="table-example-as-below">Table example as below</h2>
